# Context-Aware Speech Transformer (CAST) and Hierarchical Contextual Adaptation Strategy (HCAS)

## Introduction
Speech recognition systems have become indispensable across various applications, from virtual assistants and accessibility tools to specialized domains such as healthcare and multilingual communication. However, challenges such as accent variability, noisy environments, and domain-specific vocabulary continue to hinder performance.

This project introduces the **Context-Aware Speech Transformer (CAST)**, a novel deep learning architecture designed to address these challenges. CAST integrates:
- A **multi-scale audio encoder** for capturing local and global speech patterns.
- A **context-aware attention module** for improved robustness against noise and speaker variability.
- A **linguistic alignment decoder** for precise transcription.

To complement CAST, we propose the **Hierarchical Contextual Adaptation Strategy (HCAS)**, a comprehensive framework integrating:
- **Noise-aware feature modulation**
- **Domain-specific language adaptation**
- **Cross-domain transfer learning**

## Features
- **Multilingual Speech Recognition**: Supports multiple languages with enhanced adaptation to diverse linguistic patterns.
- **Real-time Noisy Speech Processing**: Robust transcription in challenging acoustic environments.
- **Domain-Specific Adaptation**: Optimized for applications in healthcare, customer support, and other specialized fields.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Demonstrated superior accuracy across benchmark datasets.
